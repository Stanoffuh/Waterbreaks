# Waterbreaks
In water main failure datasets, there may be significantly fewer instances of failures than non-failures. This class imbalance poses a challenge as models can become biased toward predicting the majority class (non-failure), thereby reducing the modelâ€™s ability to accurately predict failures.

Another challenge is the effectiveness of machine learning models which depends on high-quality data. Water infrastructure data can often be incomplete, inconsistent, or outdated, which hampers accurate prediction. Missing values, noise, and inaccuracies can reduce the reliability of models and may require extensive data preprocessing.
